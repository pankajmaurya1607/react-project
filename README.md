# React Project

A modern React application built with best practices and the latest features.

## Features

- **React 18+** with modern hooks and functional components
- **Component-based architecture** for modular, reusable components
- **Responsive design** ensuring compatibility across devices
- **State management** to handle complex app state
- **API integration** for dynamic content fetching
- **Unit testing setup** for reliable, maintainable code

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 16+
- **npm** or **yarn**

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pankajmaurya1607/react-project.git
cd react-project
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It optimizes the React app for the best performance, with minified code and hash filenames.

Your app will be ready for deployment!

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert it.

If you need more control over the build tool and configurations, you can `eject` to remove the single build dependency. This action copies configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. All scripts except `eject` will still work and will reference the new configurations.

For most projects, `eject` is unnecessary as Create React Appâ€™s configuration is sufficient.
